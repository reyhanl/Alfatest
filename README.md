# AlfaPlay

## Notes
I put the notes up here because it is very important, the Git history gets messed up because I made a mistake. The .gitignore ignores some very important files from the beginning resulting in the project won't run before **f58b2864c743a74579f9e35243546947fac834b6** commit.
I apologise for that, but I do hope you can still get the idea from the history.
